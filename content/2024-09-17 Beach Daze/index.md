My friend and I went in on the Lomo Trio of Incredulosity. I took the Purple, he took the Turquoise (link someday!) and Metropolis sits on my shelf. Like everyone else, I saw that magical photo that Reddit guy took with Lomo Purple and the warming filter a couple of years ago and wanted it for myself. Well, I can't say I got anything close on this foggy, rainy San Francisco day, but the bizarre color cast still looks kind of fun. I don't think I'll be shooting it again any time soon though--Lomo warns that you might see black specks all over photos taken with this film, and I definitely see those specks.

Talking about the cast, the photos below that are obnoxiously magenta rather than just a little magenta are the ones with the warming filter. That filter (a Tiffen 85b I believe) just made the photos purple across the board, almost duotone. Still waiting on the negatives from the lab though, I might try to scan them myself and see if their scanner was just having a bad time with the white balance.
