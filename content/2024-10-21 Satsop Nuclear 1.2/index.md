description: You know it's a continuation of <a href="/2024-10-13-satsop-nuclear-1.1">Satsop 1.1</a>. Photos were taken on a mix of my Olympus OM2SP w/ Kodak ProImage 100 and Harman Phoenix 200, as well as my Minolta CL w/ Fuji 200 (Kodak). Also, those Minolta CL photos aren't actually of Satsop, I just got them developed and scanned in the same batch.

Annoyingly, these rolls revealed my Olympus OM2SP has a flaw--the shutter doesn't open completed. I opened the back and shot some bulb photos after getting the scans to confirm. Results in the photos having varying vignetting on the left sides depending on the aperture. Whoops.
