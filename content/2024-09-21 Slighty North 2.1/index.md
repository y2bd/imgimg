description: Small collection of photos taken North of where I live. Calling this collection "2.1" since not only is there already a "Slightly North" collection, but these photos are just the ones I took with my Fuji X-E3 and iPhone. I have a roll of Lomo Blurple from my Pentax 17 that needs developing.
