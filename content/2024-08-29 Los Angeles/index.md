description: I have some California friends and we visit Los Angeles every so often. It's a cool place, as much as I loathe to admit it. Throughout the album, you'll see some film photos captured on my Pentax 17 with either Ilford HP5+ or Cinestill 400D (you can probably guess which is which). I had my friend who lives in Santa Barbara bring the rolls back with him and get them developed a local film lab so I didn't have to TSA XRAY them. The lab scanned them as diptychs which is fun. Had to break apart some that didn't really work as pairs though.
