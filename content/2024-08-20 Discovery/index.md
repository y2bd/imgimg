description: I'll have to put '2024' in the title since I go to Discovery Park a lot. Hell, I might go there again this year lol. This was my first roll of film on the Pentax 17 (Kodak 400) and the first roll of film I've shot since moving to Seattle. So a long time! <p>The last three photos were on my Konica TC though (Fuji C400, like the real one, the roll was six years old).
