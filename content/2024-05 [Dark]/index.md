description: These photos are from the May issue of my photo zine, titled "Dark". The first several photos are a part of a mini-series I did called "The Noise Series". The last three were from a subcondition of the zine, "constructed", where we had to take some photos where the whole scene was fully constructed by us, rather than the normal "documentary"-style photos we normally take. Fun fact--they were all taken in one burst shot.
