description: The follow-up to <a href="/2024-09-21-slighty-north-2.1">Slightly North 2.1</a>, this album contains photos also taken at Magnuson Park, but this time with my Pentax 17 and a TSA X-Ray fogged roll of Lomo Purple. There's also some non-Purple non-Park photos at the end that are just there because I needed to put Pentax 17 shots somewhere.
