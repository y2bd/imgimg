description: Pics I took at the Seattle Arboretum, an oft-visited park near me. Photos were taken with the Panasonic S5ii and the Panasonic 85mm/1.8 in its 65:24 "XPan" clone aspect ratio mode.

I went out this evening for a few reasons:

- I've been sick and stuck at home for the last two days. Things were finally getting better today so I finally got some fresh air.
- October's Zine theme (a surprise until it's done!) is lending itself towards wide aspect ratios, so I locked my camera in 65:24 mode in a familiar setting for some practice
- I had found [a cool LUT via Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Lumix/comments/17of64n/all_the_photos_i_got_in_6524_all_in_camera_using/) and wanted to give it a shot.

Before this, I had been avoiding any photographic styles on the S5 and doing all of my RAW editing in Lightroom like a good modern photo nerd. With the LUT and baked-in crop, these photos are mostly SOOC JPEGs with some minor exposure tweaks. Honestly I could have left them alone, the colors look great in the green evening!

For most of the walk, having only an 85mm was more of a hindrance than a boon. I had to step precariously back in quite a few of the shots to get everything in frame, and had to skip a bunch of shots entirely that wouldn't work with the angle of view. When I saw the owl at the end of the walk though, sheesh, I'm so glad I brought the 85 haha.
