description: These photos are from the June issue of me and my friend's photo zine, titled "Motion". After "Dark" and this, I honestly got a little sick of doing conceptual, zine-targeted photography. While I'm ultimately happy with how this extended series went, the later issues of the Zine went back to the "shoot whatever you want and figure out how to relate it to the theme later" style of photography that was much more casually enjoyable.
